      # --------
      - "Artifact manifest shall list all generated public outputs (HTML/JSON) and the state.sqlite checksum for successful runs."
      - "Retention policy shall keep evidence for at least 90 days; pruning must preserve the most recent successful run and the most recent failed run."
      - "Checksum shall use SHA-256 and must be computed over raw bytes of artifacts."
      # --------
      # E. Observability
      # --------
      - "Structured logs shall include: run_id, component=evidence, file_path, bytes_written, sha256, duration_ms."
      - "Metrics shall include: evidence_write_failures_total, evidence_bytes_total."
      - "Tracing shall include a span for evidence writing linked to run completion."
      # --------
      # F. Tests and INT E2E (clear data)
      # --------
      - "Unit tests shall cover: deterministic report formatting, checksum computation, and redaction rules."
      - "Integration tests shall cover: generating evidence for a full pipeline run and validating required sections exist."
      - "INT E2E shall clear prior evidence directories, run a full pipeline on fixtures, and verify both evidence files exist and include the required manifest/checksums."
      - "Evidence capture shall write 'features/add-evidence-capture-and-audit-trail/E2E_RUN_REPORT.md' and 'features/add-evidence-capture-and-audit-trail/STATE.md' with verifiable checksums."
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "On INT, every successful run produces a complete artifact manifest with SHA-256 checksums for HTML, JSON, and state.sqlite."
      - "On INT, evidence files contain no secret strings matching configured redaction patterns and pass an automated redaction scan."
      - "INT clear-data E2E passes and archives evidence to features/add-evidence-capture-and-audit-trail/E2E_RUN_REPORT.md and features/add-evidence-capture-and-audit-trail/STATE.md."

  - feature_key: add-int-e2e-harness
    feature_name: "Add: INT E2E harness with clear-data prerequisites and deterministic fixtures"
    is_frontend: false
    verification_url: ""
    int_credentials: ""
    context:
      - "Goal: Provide a repeatable INT end-to-end test workflow that starts from cleared data and proves correctness via archived evidence."
      - "Why now: Complex multi-source ingestion requires regression protection; unit tests alone cannot validate cross-component determinism."
      - "Scope: INT harness runs locally and in CI; fixtures emulate source payloads; non-goal is live network E2E against production sites."
    requirements:
      # --------
      # A. Scope and contracts
      # --------
      - "The harness shall define deterministic fixtures for RSS/Atom, arXiv API Atom, GitHub releases JSON, Hugging Face model list JSON, OpenReview responses, and representative HTML list pages."
      - "The harness shall provide a clear-data step that deletes/empties: SQLite state, output directory, and any cached HTTP headers for the run."
      - "The harness shall validate outputs against schemas: SQLite schema version, daily.json schema, and required HTML file presence."
      # --------
      # B. Execution semantics
      # --------
      - "The harness shall implement a test-run state machine: CLEAR_DATA -> RUN_PIPELINE -> VALIDATE_DB -> VALIDATE_JSON -> VALIDATE_HTML -> ARCHIVE_EVIDENCE -> DONE; failures halt and archive partial evidence."
      - "Idempotency: running the harness twice with the same fixtures must produce byte-identical daily.json and stable Story ordering."
      - "Concurrency: the harness shall run collectors with parallelism set to 1 by default to reduce nondeterminism; a separate test may validate parallel mode determinism."
      # --------
      # C. APIs and security
      # --------
      - "The harness shall run without external credentials by default, using fixture-backed HTTP responses; secrets must be optional."
      - "Audit logs shall record fixture versions and fixture file checksums."
      - "Security: the harness shall forbid outbound network access during fixture-backed runs (e.g., via a denylist or mock transport)."
      # --------
      # D. Storage, artifacts, retention
      # --------
      - "The harness shall store E2E artifacts under a predictable directory per feature and include a manifest with checksums."
      - "Retention: keep the last 30 E2E runs for debugging; prune deterministically."
      - "The harness shall capture a DB export (row counts by table) as part of STATE.md."
      # --------
      # E. Observability
      # --------
      - "Structured logs shall include: run_id, component=e2e, step, status, duration_ms."
      - "Metrics shall include: e2e_runs_total, e2e_failures_total{step}."
      - "Tracing shall include spans per E2E step, linked to pipeline spans via run_id."
      # --------
      # F. Tests and INT E2E (clear data)
      # --------
      - "Unit tests shall cover: fixture loaders, mock transport, and JSON schema validation."
      - "Integration tests shall cover: pipeline execution with fixtures and verification of the four digest sections (Top 5, model releases, papers, radar)."
      - "INT E2E steps must start with clearing data and must record the clear-data evidence explicitly in the report."
      - "Evidence capture shall write 'features/add-int-e2e-harness/E2E_RUN_REPORT.md' and 'features/add-int-e2e-harness/STATE.md' including fixture checksums and output checksums."
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "On INT, the harness enforces clear-data prerequisites and fails if any prior state is detected before CLEAR_DATA completes."
      - "On INT, two consecutive harness runs with identical fixtures produce byte-identical api/daily.json and stable HTML checksums."
      - "INT clear-data E2E passes and archives evidence to features/add-int-e2e-harness/E2E_RUN_REPORT.md and features/add-int-e2e-harness/STATE.md."
